Test task for Red Bridge Dev

<h2> Using </h2>
  Executable you can find in distr folder (start.bat file) Win64 only.
   This programm wrote on Lua 5.1 - in other version it will not work.
<h2> Recompile </h2>
  I compile Lua 5.1 and put it in "distr" folder.
  Also if you need to recompile (on example if you using Linux system), you can compile it from Lua src in 
  "lua-5.1.5 folder" (using make or nmake (QT)), 
  <br> In there MakeFile using g++ compiler - to change just put you'r compiler to "CC = your compiler" variable
